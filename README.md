Hello again Devs , Today I will be introducing to you all two new projects.
Both of them are linked together by using Flask , the python microframework.
The first one is a prime test, which the user is allowed to input a number, and the Python algoritym checks it if it's true or not.
Moving it further, the second allows the user to input a number that generates two list : A list containing the evens and another list containing the odd numbers within one until that given number.
Html and CSS were also used to develop the frontend of the screen, centralizing elements and uploading my layout.

Feel free to check it out, and as always, don't forget to send me your feedback.
Peace!!
